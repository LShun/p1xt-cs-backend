## Software Construction: Data Abstraction



## Introduction

So, here we are. We're finally getting off the "beginner" feel, to much more "beginner" feel! Anyways in these folders you will find various answer and materials that I have used throughout the entire course.



- The **answers** folder are mainly answers that do not involve much code. They are flowcharts, drawings, and so on.

- The **notes** folder are not solutions, but are mere notes summarizing key information from the lecture. I did not include Chapter 1 and 2, because most of the ideas found there are reiterated in the previous book, Think Java 2. Its more like a quick refresher than a new thing.
- The other folders are mainly workings and solutions dealing with code.
