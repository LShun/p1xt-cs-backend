# 10b - Search

## lambda Expression

Wow, so useful! Anyways in this lecture I learned how to create anonymouse named functions with the `lambda` keyword. 

## Sudoku

I'll be combining the rest of the videos into one part because its made up of subparts. In sudoku, I learned how to perform a brute-force search, which is where I list down all the possible outcomes, then remove all impossible outcomes, until I found a possible one.

I also learned how to perform template blending, where I relaxed the notion of the template to allow myself to blend 3 different templates together, which are the arbitrary-arity tree template (with nodes, and list of nodes, with each nodes having their own list of nodes), the generative recursion template, and finally the backtracking search template together.

Finally, *heavy sigh* I finished the Sudoku. Honestly it was pure hell for me because I entered into it without getting fully familiar with the built-in abstract functions. 

## Quiz

Well, I learned to never, ever, forgot to test the base case in a base function. Sometimes, the error can come from the base case and trip you up for hours. Well, looking forward to the next one!
