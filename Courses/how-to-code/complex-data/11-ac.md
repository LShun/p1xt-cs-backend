# Chapter 11: Accumulators

## Context Preserving Accumulators

In these series of lectures, I learned how to create context-preserving accumulators. This kind of accumulators is highly useful to keep track of positions and the "context" from before, which is lost in natural recursion.

## Tail recursion

In these series of lectures, I learned how to create functions that has "tail" properties, which means that they don't get longer (in terms of expansion) arbitrary long when dealing with arbitrary-sized data, and can save precious "stack memory" in the computer.

## Worklist accumulators

In these series of lectures, I learned how to create worklist accumulators, to make arbitrary-arity trees, mutual recursions, and backtracking search to have "tail recursion" properties.

Needless to say, I'm very excited for the next one!
