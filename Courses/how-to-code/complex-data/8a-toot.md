# Chapter 8a: Two One-of Types

## Cross product table

In this lecture, I learned how to prepare tests for functions involving two One-of data types using the cross product table.

I also learned the importance of preparing a "model" for programming before reaching out for the code. Using the model, I was able to simplify tests and combine test cases which is incredibly helpful especially when I'm forming conditions on a function consuming two one-of data types.

## Cross Product Code

In this lecture, I learned how to code using the type comments prepared in the previous video of cross product table. 

By making the cross product table, and putting pseudo-code type comments, I was able to "simplify at the model level".By using the type comments, I am able to predict the structure of the template, and produce an even simpler function.
