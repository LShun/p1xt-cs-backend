# Chapter 10a - Generative Recursion

## Introduction

In this lecture, I learned about a new type of recursion called generative recursion, in which data passed to the recursion is generated, rather than being passed to the current call.

## Fractals

In this lecture, I am able to create a function that operates on a generative recursion data. 

## Termination Arguments

In this lecture, I learned about the three parts termination arguments that is used to formulate a proof that a generative recursion function will end. This is because we can no longer count on well-formed type comments and template rules to guarantee that the recursion will end, as the data is generated as the program is running.

Looking forward to the next session!
