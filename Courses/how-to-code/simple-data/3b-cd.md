# 3b - Compound Data

## define-struct

In this lecture, I learned a tiny bit about compound data. I learned how to use the `define-struct` method to define a new compound data. I also learned how to use `type-make` to make a new variable of that compound type, `type-identifier` to access the identifiers or variables inside the compound type. Finally, I also learned how to use `type?` to check if a variable/data is of the type.
