# 3b - Compound Data

## define-struct

In this lecture, I learned a tiny bit about compound data. I learned how to use the `define-struct` method to define a new compound data. I also learned how to use `type-make` to make a new variable of that compound type, `type-identifier` to access the identifiers or variables inside the compound type. Finally, I also learned how to use `type?` to check if a variable/data is of the type.

## Cowabunga

In this lecture, I had the experience of actually building a substantial program (well, at least it had multiple functions, mixed with compound data). I actually coded a complete solution without even looking at the first lecture (therefore, missed the warning about NOT doing the geometry part without watching the lecture).
Needless to say, after around 3 hours (near the estimated time spent) my solution worked, but it was coded badly and had a lot of unnecessary variables. However, my understanding on how to build a program substantially improved. Therefore, this lecture didn't impart me on a lot of new knowledge, but it did tell me that the world is vast, and there are always better solution out there, and one always have room for improvement.

## Final Year Project

In this lecture, I learned how to use a combination of HtDF, HtDD, HtDW, and compound data to build my own program. My program is an animation of a spring jumping up and down, with the x-coordinate location controllable with a mouse-click. I also learned how to prepare your code for publishing. 

This ends the 3B section in How to Code: Simple Data, and I'm excited to go to the next.
