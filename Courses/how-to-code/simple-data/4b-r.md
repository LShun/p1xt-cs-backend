# 4a - Reference

## The reference rule, part 1

Usually, I'd be combining multiple parts of a certain topic together, but at this point, I think it might not be as "bite-sized" as previous. Therefore, I'm splitting this up.

From this lecture, I learned how to construct functions with natural references. Put it simply, functions with non-primitive/custom-defined data structures. 

I also learned the importance of setting up helper functions for natural references. I noticed this from the `tuition-graph` example where the data structure is nested in two levels. This makes it unsuitable (or very difficult) to be operated using a single function, especially taking in account of the one-function-per-function rule (what a word).

## The reference rule, part 2

From this lecture, I learned about the importance of actually implementing examples, followed by tests, before actually implementing the actual function. 

Before this, I always attempted forming a general solution to a problem first. Needless to say, that is very time-consuming, error-prone, and very frustrating. This is especially pronounced in Google Code Jam exercises where the problems are non-trivial. I learned that examples actually help us to arrive at the solution by reducing the difficulty of the problem by shrinking the scale of the problem.

By shrinking the scale of the problem, and making multiple examples to handle a different case of the problem, I can find the solution to a general problem by taking a chunk out one at a time.
