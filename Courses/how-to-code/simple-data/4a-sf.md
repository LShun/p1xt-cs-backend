# 4a - Self-reference

## Introduction to arbitrary sized data

In this lecture, I am faced with a problem that I never faced until now (which is, assuming that I never programmed before starting How to Code: Simple Data), which is the ability to handle an arbitrary sized data. One way to solve it is to use lists, which is left unclarified, and will be clarified in the next lecture.

## List mechanisms

In this lecture, I learned on how to create a list, which is a data structure that stores an arbitrary sized data. 

I am also introduced to two functions, namely `first` and `rest` which allows me to access the first variable in list, and the rest of the list. This is highly similar to a "List" data structure in C where you store the current string, and a pointer to the next part of the list.

Finally, I also learned how to determine if a list is empty through a new function called `empty?` in BSL.

## List Data definition

In this lecture, I learned how to create a data structure containing a list. I actually still used the HtDD recipe, but with a slight tuning. The most significant part is the addition of `empty` and a function, as one of the possible values. Besides that, I also performed a self-reference on the template. Now, this is interesting!

## Function operating on list

In this lecture, I am exposed on how to use functions to operate on a list through an important idea called *recursion* (recursi-ve writing, okay I'm bad at puns). I learned on how to utilize a template that contains a self-reference to write a recursive function. 

This is the hardest concept I have yet to grasp and gave me incredible amount of headache in Google Code Jam questions, and I'm ready for it!
