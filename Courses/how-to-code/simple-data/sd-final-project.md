# How to Code: Simple Data - Final Project

Oh wow, how should I say. After numerous weeks (and a long break just for fun in between), I finished the entire How to Code: Simple Data course. 

I learned so much when completing the final project, which consists of 27 functions (including helper functions). I learned more on recursion, implementing lists, performing checks and so on. Its a pretty wild ride, especially while implementing the hit-detection functions.

I have to say, this course is filled with tons of frustration, nerve-wracking challenge, and a lot of discouragement for me. I'm not a particularly bright nor experienced coder either, so its very challenging for me. I spent more than 20 hours for the final project, and more than 10 hours on some "easy-as-pie" practice problems. 

However, I believe by sticking through till the end, I learned so much that everything was worth it.

I look forward to How to Code: Complex Data!
