# 3 - How to Design World

## The big-bang Mechanism

In this 4 part lecture, I learned about a new primitive called `big-bang`. Big bang is a polymorphic primitive, that means it can take on any form. I learned how to use `big-bang` to automate the drawing, redrawing, and modification of the world and the world state.

A fun thing that I noticed is that `big-bang` is similar to a `while` loop in C, but this is just the beginning, and I'm excited.
