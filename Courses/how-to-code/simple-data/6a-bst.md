# 6 - Binary Search Trees

## List Abbreviations

In this lecture, I learned a shorthand notation for writing lists out. Instead of writing tediously using `cons`, I learned the `list` notation.

I have mixed feelings on this. I'm happy that he forced me to use `cons` which gave me a concrete understanding on how lists work, but I'm a little salty for not learning the `list` notation especially when dealing with nested, long lists.

## BST (Binary Search Trees)

I went through all the BST related lectures before writing this note, simply because I felt that these videos actually form a long lecture, split into multiple parts for ease of consumption.

I learned how to implement binary search trees in more detail compared to CS50, and understood the `log n` notation. Personally, I feel that this BST is more tedious to implement compared to lists, but is far faster. I believe this is highly applicable on large-sized and time-critical data, but not so well made for small amounts of data.

I learned more on recursion, mutual reference, and improved my skills on dealing with recursion-based functions (which previously I struggled a lot with).

Looking forward to the final project!
