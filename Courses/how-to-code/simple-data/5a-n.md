# 5a - Naturals

## Natural numbers

In this lecture, I learned how to design functions that uses natural numbers and recursion. Due to the number of the natural numbers existed being arbitrary (theres is no upper limit), a well-formed self referential data definition can be easily used to support functions operating on natural numbers (or an arbitrary amount of times, able to be quantified using natural numbers). 

## A Parlor Trick

In this lecture, I learned that besides using the predefined data definitions, we can actually create anything that we want by programming it ourselves. We can create our own numbers, own boolean function, own string. However, it is often a better idea to use the representations supplied with the programming language itself, to prevent 'reinventing the wheel'.

I'm excited for the next one, see you next week!
