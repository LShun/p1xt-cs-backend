# Exercise 1 

Computer scientists have the annoying habit of using common English words to mean something other than their common English meaning. For example, in English, statements and comments are the same thing, but in programs they are different.

In computer jargon, whatâ€™s the difference between a statement and a comment?

```
A statement is a part of a program that specifies one step of an algorithm, and causes an effect on the program when it runs. A comment however, contains information about the program, but has no effect on the program when it runs.
```

What does it mean to say that a program is portable?

```
A program is portable when it can be ran on more than one kind of computer.
```

In common English, what does the word compile mean?

In common English, the word compile means to produce (a list or a book) by assembling information collected.

What is an executable? Why is that word used as a noun?

An executable is another name for object code that is ready to run on specific hardware. That word is used as a noun because it is 'ready to be run' and not 'running'.
