# Exercise 1  

Review the documentation of java.awt.Rectangle. Which methods are pure? Which are modifiers?

Pure methods
- public Rectangle()


Modifiers
- setBounds()
- setRect()
- reshape()
- setLocation()
- move()
- setSize()

If you review the documentation of java.lang.String, you should see that there are no modifiers, because strings are immutable.
